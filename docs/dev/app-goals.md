# React Native Catalog App Goals

- Present an user-friendly gallery of AR movies for the users, as well as a log-in, settings...
- Also present a way for AR movie producers to upload their works (can be simplified for the prototype)
- Ability to download an AR movie from the catalog app & play it using Unity/ARCore
- A way to host movies on a server for instance (external to the app, but part of its system)
- Make sure an AR movie cannot easily be exported & shared for free, with encryption perhaps? (maybe not necessary for prototype)
