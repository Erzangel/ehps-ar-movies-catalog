# React-native AR Movie Catalog for mobile devices

This repository contains the **mobile application** prototype for the *ECE Horror Picture Show* engineering school project.

## App goal

The AR Movie Catalog is meant to provide a platform for both consumers and creators:

- For consumers: a catalog to choose AR movies from, launched in the [Unity AR Movie player in a separate repository](https://github.com/Erzangel/ece-horror-picture-show);
- For AR creators: a way to upload their AR movies directly to their platform.

## How to use

1. Clone this repository using either GitHub Desktop or the CLI: `git clone git@github.com:Erzangel/ece-horror-picture-show.git`;
2. Install [React-native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) on your platform, without running the init command;
3. Open an Android Emulator as described in the tutorial above, or use a physical device;
4. Open Metro in a terminal with `npx react-native start` and keep it open;
5. In another terminal tab, run `npx react-native run-android`;
6. Preview the app in the emulator/physical device;
7. Open an IDE such as VSCode and edit the `.js` React files as needed.

> Tip: When using an emulator, double-tab R to refresh the app and display changes
