# React-native AR Movie Catalog for mobile devices

This repository contains the **mobile application** prototype for the *ECE Horror Picture Show* engineering school project.

## App goal

The AR Movie Catalog is meant to provide a platform for both consumers and creators:

- For consumers: a catalog to choose AR movies from, launched in the [Unity AR Movie player in a separate repository](https://github.com/Erzangel/ece-horror-picture-show);
- For AR creators: a way to upload their AR movies directly to their platform.

## How to use

### First runs

1. Install prerequisites [for Windows & Android target as explained here](#windows-and-android-target-installation-details), or [go to the official documentation for other platforms](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup);
2. Clone this repository using either [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or Git CLI: `git clone git@github.com:Erzangel/ece-horror-picture-show.git`;
3. (Optional) If using Windows, you may install [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for a nicer terminal. Otherwise, use Powershell (right-click on the Windows icon on the bottom-left, and choose `Windows PowerShell`).
4. Using one of the two terminals described above, navigate to the project folder: `cd {path where you cloned this project}`;
5. Run `npm install`.

### Run the project

1. Open an Android Emulator with Android Studio (alternatively, use a physical device):
   1. Open the `android/` folder of this project in Android Studio
   2. Click on a button on the top right spelling `Device Manager` (the icon is a phone with the Android logo on it)
   3. Click on the Play button next to a phone if there is one in the list, otherwise create a virtual device
   4. Once the phone is started, move on
2. Open **two** terminal windows (using Git Bash or PowerShell on Windows) and navigate to the project folder: `cd {path where you cloned this project}`
3. Open Metro in the first terminal with `npx react-native start` and keep it open;
4. In the other terminal tab, run `npx react-native run-android`;
5. Preview the app in the emulator/physical device;
6. Open an IDE such as VSCode and edit the `.js` React files as needed.

> Tip: When using an emulator, double-tab R to refresh the app and display changes
